## Follows and feed (MVP #3)
When a user clicks on another user's profile, that user is taken to the profile page of said user. From there, the logged in user can see the user's username, profile picture, given name, biography, stories written, followers, and the users they are following. When a user selects a story, the user is taken directly to the story that they clicked on. Likewise, if the user clicks on one of their followers or someone they follow, they are taken to that person's profile. 

## Likes (MVP #4)
When a user clicks on a story, they are presented at the end of the story with a like button. The user can click on that like button to "like" the story, , which will display on the splash page underneath the stories display. Users can also like individual comments that are posted to stories.
