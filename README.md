## Login/Signup/Splash Pages

## Stories (MVP #1)
Our community is fostered when users create stories and look at stories from other users. When a new user enters the website without being logged in, they will be greeted with randomized content from across the website. Whereas a logged in users feed will prioritize content from other user that they follow.

## Commenting on stories (MVP #2)
We view community enagement as essential so having a comment section was a must. When a logged in user visits a story, they have the option to add comments and interact with other users. An unauthenticated user will have be prompted with a link to login in place of the comment box.

## Follows and feed (MVP #3)
When a user clicks on another user's profile, that user is taken to the profile page of said user. From there, the logged in user can see the user's username, profile picture, given name, biography, stories written, followers, and the users they are following. When a user selects a story, the user is taken directly to the story that they clicked on. Likewise, if the user clicks on one of their followers or someone they follow, they are taken to that person's profile.

## Likes (MVP #4)
When a user clicks on a story, they are presented at the end of the story with a like button. The user can click on that like button to "like" the story, , which will display on the splash page underneath the stories display. Users can also like individual comments that are posted to stories.
